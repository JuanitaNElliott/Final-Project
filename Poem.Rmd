```

I will travel, 
Eating, Seeing, Laughing. 
I'll gol, to Europe, to Asia. 
See the Pyramids in Egypt, 
Ride The London Eye in England. 

Walking the Streets of foreign cities
Or swimming in the glowing caves.
Climbing mountains to ancient cities, 
To eating Bombolone in Italy.

Iâ€™ll see the world 
And then some.
